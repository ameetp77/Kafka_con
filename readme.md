The Stream Grouping Logic Explained
This code creates a two-level mapping where Kafka messages are organized by their hash value, and within each hash group, they're indexed by their offset. Let's analyze it step by step:
1. Starting with the Stream
   javaStreamSupport.stream(records.spliterator(), false)

records is a ConsumerRecords object, which doesn't directly implement Stream
StreamSupport.stream() converts the Spliterator from records into a Stream
The false parameter indicates we want a sequential (not parallel) stream for this initial operation

2. First-Level Grouping
   java.collect(Collectors.groupingBy(
   record -> getHashValue(record),
   ...
   ))

Collectors.groupingBy() creates a Map where:

The key is the result of getHashValue(record) (an Integer)
The value is a collection of records that have the same hash value


This ensures that messages that should be processed together (same key/hash) are grouped

3. Second-Level Mapping
   javaCollectors.toMap(
   ConsumerRecord::offset,
   record -> record
   )

This creates a nested Map for each hash group
For each record in a hash group:

The key is the record's offset (ConsumerRecord::offset)
The value is the record itself (record -> record)


This inner map allows us to:

Access records by their offset within each hash group
Preserve all the original record data



4. The Resulting Data Structure
   javaMap<Integer, Map<Long, ConsumerRecord<String, String>>> recordsByHash
   This is a two-level map:

First level: Hash value (Integer) → Map of records with that hash
Second level: Offset (Long) → The actual ConsumerRecord

In Plain English
This code is saying:

"Take all the Kafka records from this poll"
"Group them by their hash value (which we calculate based on the record's key)"
"For each group, organize the records by their offset"

The Purpose
This structure allows us to:

Process related messages together: All messages with the same hash go to the same thread
Maintain order within related messages: By sorting by offset within a hash group
Track message processing: By having quick access to messages via their offsets
Balance load across threads: Different hash groups can process in parallel

This is particularly useful for maintaining ordering guarantees for related messages while still achieving parallelism across unrelated messages - exactly what you asked for with "process records that hash to the same value on the same thread."
